/**
 * This conflict resolver handles a special case, when multiple candidates of a module are
 * found, and that each of those candidates is itself selected within a list of possible answers.
 * The typical case are ranges, where we arbitrarily choose the latest version within range, at
 * the risk of selecting a version which doesn't match all constraints.
 *
 * This resolver will try to identify if the intersection of all candidates, and if it's not empty,
 * return the candidate which has the highest matching version as its upper bound.
 *
 * For example, if the 2 conflicting modules are [3,6] and [4,8], traditional conflict resolution
 * would return 8, because we resolved the first range to 6, the second range to 8, and we
 * select the highest of the two which is 8. This conflict resolver on the other hand will
 * realize that the two ranges are overlapping, and that it can select version 6.
